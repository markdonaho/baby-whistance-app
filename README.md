# Baby Whistance App (Name TBD)

A Flutter application for family and friends to guess the details of the new baby and share in the journey.

## Project Plan

### Core Setup ðŸŸ¨
- [âœ…] Flutter Project Initialization
- [âœ…] Firebase Project Setup & Integration (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- [âœ…] Basic Project Structure (folders for screens, widgets, services, models)
- [âœ…] Git Repository Initialization
- [âœ…] Basic App Navigation (e.g., using GoRouter or Navigator 2.0) - Decided on GoRouter
- [âœ…] Layout Component / Theme Setup

### Authentication (Firebase) ðŸŸ¨
- [âœ…] Email/Password Sign-up
- [âœ…] Email Verification
  - [âœ…] Send verification email on signup
  - [âœ…] Screen/flow to inform user to check email and verify
  - [âœ…] Protect routes/features based on email verification status
- [âœ…] Login (Email/Password)
- [âœ…] Logout
- [âœ…] Global Auth State Management (e.g., Provider, Riverpod, BLoC) - Implemented with Riverpod
- [âœ…] Protected Routes (redirect unauthenticated users) - Implemented with GoRouter and Riverpod
- [âœ…] User Profile Creation in Firestore (store UID, email, role, display name)
- [âœ…] Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    - [âœ…] Define Roles: `user`, `admin`, `Whistance`
    - [âœ…] Assign Roles (manual for now, or part of an invite system later)
    - [âœ…] Firestore Security Rules for Role-Based Data Access
    - [âœ…] Conditional UI elements based on role (via appUserProvider)
- [âœ…] Password Reset
- [ ] Testing for Auth Logic

### User Features (Home Page / Main User Flow) â¬œ
- [ ] **Guess Submission**
    - [ ] Data Model for Guesses (user_id, date_of_birth_guess, time_of_birth_guess, weight_guess, length_guess, hair_color_guess, eye_color_guess, etc.)
    - [ ] UI Form for Submitting Guesses
    - [ ] Save Guesses to Firestore
    - [ ] Display User's Current Guess(es)
- [ ] **Guess Editing**
    - [ ] Allow users to edit their own guesses
    - [ ] Editing disabled if `guessing_status` is "closed"
- [ ] **View Other Users' Guesses (Post-Reveal)**
    - [ ] Conditionally display all guesses after an admin reveals the actual details.
- [ ] **View Baby Details (Post-Reveal)**
    - [ ] Display actual baby details once entered by an Admin/Whistance.

### "Whistance" Role Features (Mom & Dad) â¬œ
- [ ] **Photo Journey Upload**
    - [ ] UI for uploading images (e.g., pregnancy journey, ultrasound pics)
    - [ ] Store images in Firebase Storage
    - [ ] Link images to a "journey" collection in Firestore (caption, uploader, timestamp)
- [ ] **Photo Journey Display**
    - [ ] Cute and engaging way to display uploaded photos (e.g., gallery, timeline, slideshow)
    - [ ] Accessible to all authenticated users.
- [ ] **(Potentially) Enter Actual Baby Details**
    - [ ] Form to input the actual birth details once the baby arrives.

### Admin Features â¬œ
- [ ] **User Management (Basic)**
    - [ ] View list of users
    - [ ] Manually assign/change user roles (if not using an invite system with pre-assigned roles)
- [ ] **Guessing Management**
    - [ ] Set `guessing_status` (e.g., "open", "closed", "revealed")
        - [ ] When "closed", users can no longer submit/edit guesses.
        - [ ] When "revealed", actual details are shown, and perhaps all guesses.
    - [ ] Input Actual Baby Details (if not handled by "Whistance" role)
    - [ ] (Optional) Trigger calculation of "winners" or closest guesses.
- [ ] **Content Management (Photos)**
    - [ ] Ability to moderate/delete uploaded photos if necessary.

### UI/UX â¬œ
- [ ] Basic Responsive Layout for Web (and mobile if also targeting native)
- [ ] Consistent Theme and Styling
- [ ] User-Friendly Navigation
- [ ] Loading States and Feedback
- [ ] Error Handling and User Notifications


### Security
- [ ] Make sure everything is secure and safe
- [ ] Never actually complete as long as the app is deployed

### Backend (Firebase) â¬œ
- [ ] **Firestore Data Models:**
    - [ ] `users` (uid, email, displayName, role, createdAt)
    - [ ] `guesses` (userId, submittedAt, lastEditedAt, dateGuess, timeGuess, weightGuess, lengthGuess, hairColorGuess, eyeColorGuess)
    - [ ] `photos` (uploaderId, imageUrl, caption, uploadedAt, sortOrder)
    - [ ] `app_status` (or similar, for `guessing_status`, `actual_baby_details`)
- [ ] **Firebase Storage:**
    - [ ] Rules for photo uploads (only authenticated users, size limits, etc.)
- [ ] **Firebase Authentication:**
    - [ ] Standard email/password setup.
    - [ ] Email verification enforcement.
- [ ] **Firestore Security Rules:**
    - [ ] Users can only read/write their own guesses (unless `guessing_status` is "revealed").
    - [ ] "Whistance" role can upload photos.
    - [ ] "Admin" role can manage users and `app_status`.
    - [ ] All authenticated users can read photos.

### Future Features / Ideas â¬œ
- [ ] Games
- [ ] User Invites System
- [ ] Notifications (e.g., when guessing closes, when baby details are revealed)
- [ ] "Closest Guess" Highlighting / Leaderboard
- [ ] More detailed user profiles
- [ ] PWA Capabilities
- [ ] Admin dashboard enhancements

## Known Issues / Next Steps
- **P1: Investigate `LoginScreen` unmounting during login process:**
  - **Symptom:** After a successful authentication call, `LoginScreen._login()` finds `!mounted` is true before it can execute its explicit navigation (`context.goNamed`).
  - **Current State:** Login flow *is functional* because `GoRouter` correctly redirects to `/home` after `AuthController` updates its state.
  - **Concern:** The `LoginScreen` becoming unmounted prematurely is a code smell and could indicate instability or lead to other subtle bugs (e.g., if `_isLoading` isn't reset correctly in all paths, though the current `finally` block handles this).
  - **Possible Causes to Investigate:**
    - Unintentional/automatic hot restarts (IDE settings, other tools).
    - Parent widget rebuilding and replacing `LoginScreen` due to auth state changes.
    - Aggressive/premature navigation or widget replacement by GoRouter itself during the auth flow.
    - Deeper Flutter framework issue or subtle bug related to `async/await` and widget lifecycle.

**Brief Description:**

*   **`main.dart`**: Initializes the app, Firebase, and sets up `MaterialApp.router` with the `appRouter`.
*   **`config/`**: Contains global application configuration.
    *   `router/app_router.dart`: Manages all navigation logic using `GoRouter`, defining routes and their corresponding screens.
*   **`core/`**: Houses fundamental utilities, global constants, base classes, error handling mechanisms, and potentially dependency injection setup. This code is foundational and used across the entire application.
*   **`shared/`**: Contains elements that are reusable across multiple features but are not as foundational as those in `core/`.
    *   `models/`: For data models that don't strictly belong to a single feature and are used by several (e.g., `AppUser`).
    *   `services/`: For application-level services that might be consumed by various features (e.g., a global notification service).
    *   `widgets/`: For common UI components (e.g., custom buttons, dialogs, list items) that are used in multiple feature modules. **Note:** Actively look for opportunities to extract reusable components from individual feature pages into this directory to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication.
*   **`features/`**: Each subdirectory within `features/` represents a distinct functional module of the application (e.g., `auth`, `home`).
    *   **`application/`**: Contains the business logic for the feature, such as state management (Riverpod Providers like `authControllerProvider` and `authRepositoryProvider`, Notifiers like `AuthController`), use cases, or application services.
    *   **`domain/`** (Conceptual - To be added as needed): Includes the core business logic, entities, and interfaces (abstract repositories) for the feature, independent of any framework or infrastructure.
        *   `repositories/`: Abstract contracts defining data operations (e.g., `AuthRepository`).
    *   **`infrastructure/`** (Conceptual - To be added as needed): Implements the interfaces defined in the `domain` layer, handling external concerns like data fetching (repositories), device services, etc.
        *   `repositories/`: Concrete implementations of repository interfaces (e.g., `FirebaseAuthRepository`).
    *   **`presentation/`**: Holds all UI-related code for the feature.
        *   `screens/`: Contains the top-level widgets that represent full screens or pages.
        *   `widgets/`: Contains smaller, reusable UI components specific to this feature.

*Global directories like `lib/models/`, `lib/widgets/`, `lib/services/` can be created if there's a need for truly shared components or utilities not specific to any single feature.*
