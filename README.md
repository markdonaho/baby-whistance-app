# Baby Whistance App (Name TBD)

## Next Development Focus (as of 2025-05-16)

- **Navigate back to AllGuesses when a user who has navigated to edit submits their changes successfully
- **Implement "Dev Area / Proposed Scoring Rules" Screen:**
    - Create a simple informational screen for scoring rules and feedback gathering.

A Flutter application for family and friends to guess the details of the new baby and share in the journey.

## Known Issues / Next Steps
- **P1: Investigate `LoginScreen` unmounting during login process:**
  - **Symptom:** After a successful authentication call, `LoginScreen._login()` finds `!mounted` is true before it can execute its explicit navigation (`context.goNamed`).
  - **Current State:** Login flow *is functional* because `GoRouter` correctly redirects to `/home` after `AuthController` updates its state.
  - **Concern:** The `LoginScreen` becoming unmounted prematurely is a code smell and could indicate instability or lead to other subtle bugs (e.g., if `_isLoading` isn't reset correctly in all paths, though the current `finally`
    block in `LoginScreen._login()` seems to handle it for now).
- **Firebase Index for `guesses` collection (userId ASC, submittedAt DESC) created.**
